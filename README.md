# Paper Notes


what makes a great paper? some argue, that only the famous researchers write those papers. we see this trend periodically in research: a class of researchers get one great idea, cash out, and then stop publishing (which is an absolutely correct personal choice). Another class of concentrated 1-3 people, seem to get all the good ideas in the field (just a general observation, causality need not imply correlation). So, this is just a small attempt to see what the good folks have been doing. 

Another question i get from the people is how i classify great papers. Obviously, the most cited papers are an obvious choice. The trick seems to be selecting the low cited papers which are recently published and might have potential to seed new research ideas. Obviously, i dont have any recipe for selecting those and rather go with my gut. One way i find being helpful is : is the paper application based, or solves a fundamental problem. I'd rather choose the latter category. Another thing which seems to be helpful is that the older papers of the established researchers seem to have established the philosophy of their research. 

The way i have come to see research is: 1) describe material nature in terms of fundamental laws. 2) invent or reuse the maths to put those laws into existing machines 3) engineering those insights into a working model. Most of the well cited papers will land in 3) and for beginners its absolutely important to stay in 3). But, then one might hit a level when ones intuition cannot be expplained by the existing laws made by man, and that is the time when philosophy i.e. papers in 1) shall help. you will then be responsible for inventing the math and engineering to develop the things that ought to be the way you think. Mind you, your entire life might be spent on just one of such fundamental points. 

However, i would caution the prospective reader to two things 1) You dont want to read too much philosophy, for philosophers have a way of arguing on the same point and come onto conflicting opinions on the same thing. It takes a great deal of maturity to know what philosophical point can be built into an engineering perspective. That's the reason i only read one or two top philosophers in the field and not anymore. You have a finite life and philosophy is infinite. 2) The second piece of advice is to understand the difference between research and engineering: great papers are never written by incremental improvements. If you do choose to do incremental work (which is also equally important), you must know that you have made a conscious choice and be okay with it not having a great impact. Chances are you will spend the rest of your career publishing many such papers or writing surveys (under many collaborations). If you ever want to do great sort of work, you have to study how other great people thought, and how you can learn from them. I warn you: this is a lonely path, people around you will not be able to help you, and chances are you will mostly end up working alone (unless you find someone as excited as you.). 99% of the people wont venture beyond their own subfields, and will definitely not read very old papers. 

However, i digress on those points: unlike fundamental sciences like physics and mathematics, artificial intelligence is different : great ideas seem to be reinvented time and time again, and only seem to work when given enought compute. So there are high chances that someone in older times has already invented a version of what you are thinking. So, it shall be helpful to think of the older papers and spend some time learning from the masters. 


Another important thing i frequently advice people on is: 
If you still choose to accept the things that come with doing some good work (the untold side of things,), i wish you a very best. This repo hosts some of the greatest papers i have read. If you think there is some other paper that ought to be a part of this list, then do open an issue here. 


The areas i am interested in are:
- computer vision 
- machine learning 
- philosophy of mind 
- cybernetics 
- biological intelligence 
- cognitive sciences 

deep learning is not mentioned here since learning need not be deep (although it seems to be what all the craze is about as of 2023.). I categorize it into a form of machine learning. Perhaps, future shall have an interesting thing in store for us (which i wont say much about until some of my experiments work). 

All the best, and i hope you get a chance to do some great work in the future. I even hope that for myself lol. 

After all: "Man Maketh Machine". There might come a time soon when machines make themselves or a man becomes indistinguishable from a machine.
