what makes a great paper? some argue, that only the famous researchers write those papers. we see this trend periodically in research: a class of researchers get one great idea, cash out, and then stop publishing (which is an absolutely correct personal choice). Another class of concentrated 1-3 people, seem to get all the good ideas in the field (just a general observation, causality need not imply correlation). So, this is just a small attempt to see what the good folks have been doing. 

Another question i get from the people is how i classify great papers. Obviously, the most cited papers are an obvious choice. The trick seems to be selecting the low cited papers which are recently published and might have potential to seed new research ideas. Obviously, i dont have any recipe for selecting those and rather go with my gut. One way i find being helpful is : is the paper application based, or solves a fundamental problem. I'd rather choose the latter category. Another thing which seems to be helpful is that the older papers of the established researchers seem to have established the philosophy of their research. 

The way i have come to see research is: 1) describe material nature in terms of fundamental laws. 2) invent or reuse the maths to put those laws into existing machines 3) engineering those insights into a working model. Most of the well cited papers will land in 3) and for beginners its absolutely important to stay in 3). But, then one might hit a level when ones intuition cannot be expplained by the existing laws made by man, and that is the time when philosophy i.e. papers in 1) shall help. 

However, i would caution the prospective reader to two things 1) You dont want to read too much philosophy, for philosophers have a way of arguing on the same point and come onto conflicting opinions on the same thing. It takes a great deal of maturity to know what philosophical point can be built into an engineering perspective. That's the reason i only read one or two top philosophers in the field and not anymore. You have a finite life and philosophy is infinite. 2) The second piece of advice is to understand the difference between research and engineering: great papers are never written by incremental improvements. If you ever want to do that sort of work, you have to study how other great people thought, and how you can learn from them. I warn you: this is a lonely path, people around you will not be able to help you, and chances are you will mostly end up working alone (unless you find someone as excited as you.)

If you still choose to accept the things that come with doing some good work (the untold side of things,), i wish you a very best. This repo hosts some of the greatest papers i have read. If you think there is some other paper that ought to be a part of this list, then do open an issue here. 


The areas i am interested in are:
- computer vision 
- machine learning 
- philosophy of mind 
- cybernetics 
- biological intelligence 
- cognitive sciences 

deep learning is not mentioned here since learning need not be deep (although it seems to be what all the craze is about now.) Perhaps, future shall have an interesting thing in store for us.
